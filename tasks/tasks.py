# Flow=>
# Step1: get all the users who have schedule object associated with them
# Step2: from those users filter the users to whom email is not sent within 24 hrs
# As we have to send one email daily so we will check if there are any emails send
# to that user in 24 hrs if not we keep them
# Step3: filter out users who have schedule time less than the current time. This handles
# every case of workder stop responding for any amount of time
# Step4: After sending them mail update the prev_sent time
# On updating the time if cuurent time is more than updated time
# a mail is sent irrespective of current time from next day
# it is sent at correct timings
# TODO: Limit user to update schedule a certain number of times a day
# to prevent email overloading on worker
